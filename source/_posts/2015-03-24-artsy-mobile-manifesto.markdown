Recently, the Artsy Mobile team had the pleasure of working together on [an article](http://www.objc.io/issue-22/artsy.html) for [objc.io](http://www.objc.io), an online publication dedicated to in-depth articles about iOS and OS X development. Each monthly issue consists of several articles centered around a theme—past issues include [Testing](http://www.objc.io/issue-15/), [Animations](http://www.objc.io/issue-12/) and [Swift](http://www.objc.io/issue-16/). objc.io’s latest issue, [iOS at Scale](http://www.objc.io/issue-22), features articles by a handful of developers about how they approach iOS development at their respective companies. Our contribution to the the issue is a collaboratively-written article by and about Artsy’s Mobile team, specifically focusing on one of the core principles behind how we (and the greater Artsy Engineering team) work: Open Source by Default.

iOS at Artsy is characterized by a culture of open-source stewardship. Although our team is small, our contributions to the Cocoa developer community are significant. We hope our manifesto sheds some light on our development and testing practices while also providing a high-level look into our team’s philosophy.
