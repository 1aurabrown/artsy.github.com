        A Ruby full-text search implementation for the Mongoid ODM. MongoDB currently has no native full-text search capabilities,
so this gem is a good fit for cases where you want something a little less than a full-blown indexing service like Solr. The
mongoid_fulltext gem lets you do a fuzzy string search across relatively short strings, which makes it good for populating
autocomplete boxes based on the display names of your Rails models but not appropriate for, say, indexing hundreds of thousands
of HTML documents.

    - name: mongoid-cached-json
      repo: dblock/mongoid-cached-json
      description: >
         Typical as_json definitions may involve lots of database point queries and method calls. When returning collections of objects, a single call may yield hundreds of database queries that can take seconds. This library mitigates the problem by implementing a module called CachedJson.

CachedJson enables returning multiple JSON formats from a single class and provides some rules for returning embedded or referenced data. It then uses a scheme where fragments of JSON are cached for a particular (class, id) pair containing only the data that doesn't involve references/embedded documents. To get the full JSON for an instance, CachedJson will combine fragments of JSON from the instance with fragments representing the JSON for its references. In the best case, when all of these fragments are cached, this falls through to a few cache lookups followed by a couple Ruby hash merges to create the JSON.

Using Mongoid::CachedJson we were able to cut our JSON API average response time by about a factor of 10.
